## Angular-custom-filter-for-minutes-to-12hr-clock-conversion

This is an *AngularJs* **custom Filter** to convert Minutes format to Hour format for a day.
(i.e if minutes are 120 filter should convert it to hour and show 2:00am, similarly for 1200 minutes it shows 10:00pm.)
Pushing of multiple data into nested array is also implemented.
